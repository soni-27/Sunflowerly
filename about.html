        <h2>Aastha Soni</h2>
      
        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m Aastha â€” a sincere girl<br>
          who loves to read, paint, swim,<br>
          and sometimes knit.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I grew up in a lively family<br>
          that moved cities quite often.<br>
          My dad worked in a government bank,<br>
          which meant frequent transfers.<br>
          Each move taught me to adapt<br>
          and enjoy new beginnings.<br>
          Now, as a new aunt,<br>
          I hope to become someone<br>
          my niece might look up to.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always loved creativity and community.<br>
          From leading my school magazine<br>
          to managing digital media in college,<br>
          Iâ€™ve sought roles with real purpose.<br>
          I now freelance in market research<br>
          and volunteer with Earth Hero.<br>
          Both keep me grounded and learning.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I dream of work that blends<br>
          beauty, benefit, and good â€”<br>
          creative, rewarding, and meaningful.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Hereâ€™s a fun little snippet about me:<br>
          I make a bookmark for each book.<br>
          The front has a tiny painting<br>
          and the bookâ€™s title and author.<br>
          The back holds my favorite line.<br>
          Iâ€™ve made over 100 so far â€”<br>
          each one a memory of reading.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I value meaning in my work,<br>
          in stories, and in people too.<br>
          Maybe Iâ€™m the leap of faith<br>
          youâ€™ve been waiting to take. ðŸŒ»
